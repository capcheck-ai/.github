# CapCheck

The core verification infrastructure powering independent fact-checking for the internet.

## What This Is

CapCheck.ai houses the technical infrastructure that powers the nonprofit's educational tools and research initiatives. We're building the verification platform that enables media literacy education and advances fact-checking research.

**Operated by:** CapCheck (501c3 nonprofit)
**Purpose:** Support education and research in media literacy and fact-checking  

## Future Direction

We're pivoting to smaller, custom-trained models based on the principle that **truth should be simple**. Goals:

- Train 3B and 7B parameter models for fact-checking
- Enable local execution (complete privacy, offline capability)
- Reduce costs 10x while maintaining accuracy
- Partner with Nous Research Thinking Machines API
